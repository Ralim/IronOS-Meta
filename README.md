# IronOS-Meta

Storing meta information for IronOS.
This are things that are not part of the core "OS".
This includes photographs of hardware, datasheets, schematics and of course **bootup logos**.

This repository uses github actions to automagically build the logos for each device.
Periodically a "release" will be tagged and pre-compiled logo's will be put there as well to make it easy.
